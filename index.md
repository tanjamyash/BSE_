# Obstacle Avoiding Robot
 I am working on creating a robot that will avoid obstacles in a given path. Furthermore if an object is close to the robot there will be a beep which will direct the robot to move out of the obstacle's path. I am doing this project to increase my knowledge upon robotics and to gain a new experience.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone I finished assembling the chassis for my robot. In addition, I finished soldering all 4 dc motors and connected it onto the hbridge. I initially faced problems with the battery connection and I solved that problem throughout implementing a breadboard system to extend the connection of the wires which allowed my robot to get a good source of potential difference. I also coded my obstacle avoiding robot to move towards the left and right side.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Ultra Sonic Sensor  which is used to measure the distnace for my robot and all the necessary components onto my arduino. Inaddition I worked on soldering 2 dc motors and connected it onto my hbridge. For my future steps I will finish soldering the rest of the DC motors and I will assemble the robot chassis.
